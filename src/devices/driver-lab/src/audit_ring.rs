//! Bounded target-side audit ring.
//!
//! Sequence numbers increase monotonically for the life of the proxy
//! instance. Wrap overwrites the oldest entries but never reuses or resets
//! sequence numbers, so a host reading from a stale cursor can detect the
//! gap. The ring is in-memory: undrained entries are lost if the driver
//! host crashes, which is why hosts drain incrementally during mutating
//! plans.
