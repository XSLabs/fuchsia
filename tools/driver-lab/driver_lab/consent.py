"""Interactive operator consent for unknown register reads.

An access that matches neither an active plan approval nor a persistent
grant is undecided. In unattended operation it fails closed; with a
consent prompt attached, the operator chooses one of four decisions. The
persistent choices store the exact access rule -- never a region, range,
or wildcard.
