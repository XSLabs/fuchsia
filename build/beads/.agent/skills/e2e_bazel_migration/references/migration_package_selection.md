# Migration Package Selection

## 1. Find a package

Use the "gsheets" skill: In the **control table**, find the first row from the top where the "Migration Status" column is "ready_for_migration" and the "Owner" column is empty.
   * If no row meets the requirements, fail the Migration Package Selection step with the reason: "No migration package is found."
   * The row that meets the requirements is the **migration package**.


## 2. Claim migration ownership

For the **migration package**, update the "Owner" column to the current user to claim ownership.

Wait for 5 seconds and then re-check the row whether the "Owner" column is the current user.
   * If not, refer to [Find a package](#1-find-a-package) to find another package for the migration.


## 3. Check for an existing migration CL

After the ownership of the **migration package** is claimed, use the "fuchsia-gerrit-cli" skill to check whether the **migration package** has already been migrated and a CL has been generated for it (e.g., search all CL states for changes whose subject contains `[bazel_migration]` and whose affected files include the `BUILD.gn` or `BUILD.bazel` of the **migration package** directory).
   * If such a CL is found, use the "gsheets" skill to update the "Migration Status" column of the **migration package** to "migrated", and then refer to [Find a package](#1-find-a-package) to find another package for the migration.
   * Otherwise, continue to the next step.


## 4. Check the Buganizer Ticket

For the **migration package**, if the "Buganizer Ticket" column is empty, refer to [Buganizer ticket template](../assets/buganizer_ticket_template.md) to create a Buganizer ticket for this migration with "buganizer-cli" agent skill and write it to the "Buganizer Ticket" column.
   * If it fails to create the ticket, use the "Parent ID" defined in the [Buganizer ticket template](../assets/buganizer_ticket_template.md) as the Buganizer ticket number and write to the "Buganizer Ticket" column.

## 5. Update Control Table

After the ownership of the **migration package** is claimed, change "Migration Status" to "in-progress".
